DownloadRouterConfig.py
=======================

Needs Fixing:
-------------

New Features:
-------------
[ ] 1. Tidy up the application root directory by automatically creating a
    subdirectory to hold router configuration files.
[ ] 2. Move application variables to a config file?
[ ] 3. Error checking: 'routers.lst' exist?
[ ] 4. Error checking: Enable access upon login?

Nice To Have:
-------------
[ ] 1. Adding a description of common errors encountered (as defined by and
    recorded by the Exscript module)?
[X] 2. Separate the 'rewriteOutputFile' operations into their own function to
    prevent any possible interruption/delays in downloading config files.
