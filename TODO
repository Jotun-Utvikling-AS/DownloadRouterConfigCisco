DownloadRouterConfig.py
=======================

Needs Fixing:
-------------

New Features:
-------------
[ ] Move application variables to a config file?
[ ] Error checking: Enable access upon login?
[X] Error checking: 'routers.lst' exist?
[X] Tidy up the application root directory by automatically creating a
    subdirectory to hold router configuration files.

Nice To Have:
-------------
[ ] Adding a description of common errors encountered (as defined by and
    recorded by the Exscript module)?
[X] Separate the 'rewriteOutputFile' operations into their own function to
    prevent any possible interruption/delays in downloading config files.
