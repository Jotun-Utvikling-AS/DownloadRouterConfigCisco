DownloadRouterConfig.py
=======================

Needs Fixing:
-------------
[ ] Separate the 'rewriteOutputFile' operations into their own function to
    prevent any possible interruption/delays in downloading config files.
[ ] Error checking for presense of 'routers.list' file in root directory.

New Features:
-------------
[ ] Tidy up the application root directory by automatically creating a
    subdirectory to hold router configuration files.
[ ] Move application variables to a config file?
