DownloadRouterConfig.py 2.14 (2013-04-12)
-----------------------------------------
! Discovered bug: Queue function seems to cap out at 4,573 hosts?
+ Renamed 'logs' directory to 'configs' to be consistent with what
  the application is actually doing. (It's not downloading logs.)
+ Added date to the 'status.log' file for easier identification and to
  prevent the file being recently overwritten.  May eventually change
  date to be a timestamp instead?

DownloadRouterConfig.py 2.14 (2013-04-11)
-----------------------------------------
+ Added error checking for 'routers.lst' file.
+ Added ability for application to save log files to a subdirectory.

DownloadRouterConfig.py 2.13 (2013-04-10)
-----------------------------------------
+ Updated CHANGELOG: New version
+ Updated README: Cleaned up some text
+ Updated TODO: Changed format a bit, checked off item
* Moved some code around just to tidy things up (functionality not changed).
- Removed unimportant debugging information from the code that displayed
  current operation as the logging capabilities of the queue are informative
  enough.
- Removed the 'rewriteOutputFile' operation because testing showed that
  Notepad++ (the default editor I use in Windows) is the only application
  that displays duplicate blank lines whereas other text editors do not.
