DownloadRouterConfig.py
=======================

About:
------
DownloadRouterConfig.py is a Python application that downloads the 
running-config of a Cisco router.

Dependencies:
-------------
Exscript module https://github.com/knipknap/exscript/

Requirements:
-------------
1. This application is hard-coded to use the SSH2 protocol; If SSH v2 is not
   enabled on your router(s), you will need to:
   a.) Add 'ip ssh version 2' to your Cisco router(s) configuration
   b.) Alter the 'default_protocol' variable in the get_hosts_from_file
       function to use a different protocol.
2. A valid username/password to access the Cisco router.
3. A 'routers.lst' file in the same directory as the script which contains
   a list, one per line, of hostnames or IP addresses the application will
   then connect to and download the running-config of.

Assumptions:
------------
1. This application was written for use on Cisco IOS devices and cannot be
   guaranteed to work on other makes/model routers.
2. This application assumes that you have enable privileges on each router
   in order to execute the 'show running-config' command.  If you do not
   have sufficient user privileges, this application will not work as
   designed.

Limitations:
------------
1. This application uses the same username/password to access ALL routers. If
   your routers use unique usernames/passwords, then this script will not work.
2. This application is hard-coded to connect to FOUR routers simultaneously.
   I wrote this application in an environment where Cisco routers authenticate
   against a Cisco ACS and found FOUR simultaneous requests to be the maximum
   number of requests before regular authentication failures began happening.
   If you use static usernames/passwords in your environment, feel free to
   increase the 'max_threads' variable in the 'Queue' function.

Functionality:
--------------
1. Upon execution, the application will prompt the user for a username and
   password.  This username/password will be used to login to all routers
   specified in the 'routers.lst' file.
2. The application will write the running-config contents of each router to
   a file using the format, 'HOSTNAME_Config_YYYY-MM-DD.txt', where HOSTNAME is
   the hostname (or IP address) specified in the 'routers.lst' file and
   YYYY-MM-DD is the numerical Year-Month-Day of the box executing the
   application.
